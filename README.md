# swift

The repository consists of the basic swift programs. I am sharing the basic apps which can be fun to use.
1. Greetings App. 
  The app just takes a name and greets the person. The purpose of this app is to learn the binding of labels and Texts with     the swift controller. It can be as basic as any swift binding can be.
