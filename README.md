# swift

The repository consists of the basic swift programs. I am sharing the basic apps which can be fun to use. Also, as you have noticed the apps are in compressed form for making it easy to download and use. All that is required is to unzip and open the apps in xcode.

1. Greetings App. 
  The app just takes a name and greets the person. The purpose of this app is to learn the binding of labels and Texts with     the swift controller. It can be as basic as any swift binding can be.
2. Cat Years App.
  The app requests user to enter the age of the cat in years and displays the cat age of it. (Cat age is actual age * 7). The   basic purpose of this app is to get aqquainted with the type conversions and how to change the content of a UI element with   code. 
3. The prime number app 
   The app takes an input from user and determines if the number is a prime number or not. Basic simple app which helps          understanding the operators.
4. Timer App
   The app presents a timer which provides start, pause, reset, add 10 secs and subtract 10 secs functionality. The purpose of    this app is to get aqquainted with swift timer.
